spart_decrypt.py

Illustration of how to read, decrypt and decode the contents
of a binary SPARTN log file e.g. from an Thingstream PointPerfect
SPARTN MQTT or NTRIP service.

NB: data stream must ONLY contain SPARTN protocol messages. If you're
capturing a log from a Thingstream PointPerfect SPARTN MQTT service,
disable the 'Key' and 'Assist' topics, as these return UBX protocol
messages.

At time of writing, the MQTT service uses encrypted payloads (`eaf=1`).
In order to decrypt and decode these payloads, a valid decryption `key`
is required. Keys are typically 32-character hexadecimal strings valid
for a 4 week period e.g. "bc75cdd919406d61c3df9e26c2f7e77a"

In addition to the key, the SPARTN decryption algorithm requires a 32-bit
`gnssTimeTag` value. The provision of this 32-bit `gnssTimeTag` depends on
the incoming data stream:
- Some SPARTN message types (*e.g. HPAC and a few OCB messages*) include
  the requisite 32-bit `gnssTimeTag` in the message header (denoted by
  `timeTagtype=1`). Others (*e.g. GAD and most OCB messages*) use an
  ambiguous 16-bit `gnssTimeTag` value for reasons of brevity (denoted by
  `timeTagtype=0`). In these circumstances, a nominal 'basedate' must be
  provided by the user, representing the UTC datetime on which the datastream
  was originally created to the nearest half day, in order to convert the
  16-bit `gnssTimeTag` to an unambiguous 32-bit value.
- If you're parsing data in real time, this basedate can be set to `None` and
  will default to the current UTC datetime `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
- If you're parsing historical data, you will need to provide a basedate
  representing the UTC datetime on which the data stream was originally
  created, to the nearest half day, or...
- If a nominal basedate of `TIMEBASE` (`datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, tzinfo=timezone.utc)`)
  is provided, `pyspartn.SPARTNReader` can *attempt* to derive the requisite `gnssTimeTag`
  value from any 32-bit `gnssTimetag` in a preceding message of the same subtype in the
  same data stream, but *unless and until this eventuality occurs (e.g. unless an HPAC
  message precedes an OCB message of the same subtype), decryption may fail*. Always set
  the `quitonerror` argument to `ERRLOG` or `ERRIGNORE` to log or ignore such initial
  failures.

Usage:

python3 spartn_decrypt.py infile="inputfilename.log" key="bc75cdd919406d61c3df9e26c2f7e77a", \
    basedate=431287200

Basedate must be in 32-bit gnssTimeTag integer format - use date2timetag() to convert datetime.

Run from /examples folder. Example is set up to use 'd9s_spartn_data.bin' file by default.
