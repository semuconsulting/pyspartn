spart_decrypt.py

Illustration of how to read, decrypt and parse the contents
of a binary SPARTN log file e.g. from an Thingstream PointPerfect
SPARTN MQTT or NTRIP service.

NB: decryption requires the key and basedate applicable at the
time the SPARTN log was originally captured.

Usage:

python3 spartn_decrypt.py infile="inputfilename.log" key="bc75cdd919406d61c3df9e26c2f7e77a", basedate=431287200

Basedate must be in 32-bit gnssTimeTag integer format - use date2timetag() to convert datetime.

Run from /examples folder. Example is set up to use 'd9s_spartn_data.bin' file by default.

FYI: SPARTNMessage objects implement a protected attribute `_padding`,
which represents the number of redundant bits added to the payload
content in order to byte-align the payload with the exact number of
bytes specified in the transport layer payload length nData. If the
payload has been successfully decrypted and decoded, the value of
_padding should always be between 0 and 8.
