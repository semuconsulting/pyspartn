spartn_ntrip_client.py

Illustration of SPARTN NTRIP Client using GNSSNTRIPClient
class from pygnssutils library. Can be used with the 
u-blox Thingstream PointPerfect NTRIP service.

NB: requires a valid userid and password. These can be set as
environment variables PYGPSCLIENT_USER and PYGPSCLIENT_PASSWORD,
or passed as keyword arguments user and password.

The contents of the binary output file can be parsed and decoded using
the spartn_decrypt.py example. At time of writing the PointPerfect
NTRIP service is unencrypted (eaf=0), so key and basedate can be set
to arbitrary values.

Usage:

python3 spartn_ntrip_client.py user="youruser" password="yourpassword" outfile="spartnntrip.log"

Run from /examples folder.
